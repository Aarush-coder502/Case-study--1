# Grocery Item Calculator

# Prices of items
apple_price = 5.0
banana_price = 2.0
orange_price = 4.0
bread_price = 1.0

# Getting user input for the number of items
apple = int(input("Enter the quantity of apples: "))
banana = int(input("Enter the quantity of bananas: "))
orange = int(input("Enter the quantity of oranges: "))
bread = int(input("Enter the quantity of loaves of bread: "))

# Calculating total cost for each item
apple_cost = apple * apple_price
banana_cost = banana * banana_price
orange_cost = orange * orange_price
bread_cost = bread * bread_price

# Total cost
total_cost = apple_cost + banana_cost + orange_cost + bread_cost

# Displaying the result
if total_cost > 0:
    print(f"\nTotal cost for your groceries:")
    print(f"Apples: ${apple_cost:.2f}")
    print(f"Bananas: ${banana_cost:.2f}")
